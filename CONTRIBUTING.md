# Contributing to Slash3

If you're here to contribute a bug report, feature request, code fix or improvement, _thank you!_ This guide will help get your contribution into the project as quickly and smoothly as possible.

## Bug reports

Please raise your issue at [github.com/cariad/slash3/issues](https://github.com/cariad/slash3/issues) and include as much detail as possible; ideally with a full code sample that reproduces the problem.

## Feature requests

Please raise feature requests at [github.com/cariad/slash3/issues](https://github.com/cariad/slash3/issues) and include as much detail as possible.

## Code changes

To avoid wasting your time, I will pull only code changes that we have already discussed as a bug report or feature request. Unexpected changes will not be pulled.

If there's a change you'd like to make, mention this in the related issue and we'll take the discussion from there.

All code changes must have the best reasonable unit test coverage and documentation updates.
