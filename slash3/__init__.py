## Introduction

**Slash3** is a Python package for building and navigating Amazon Web Services
S3 URIs.

For example:

```python
from slash3 import S3Uri

zombies = S3Uri("s3://burgers/staff/zombies.jpg")
print(zombies.bucket)  # "burgers"
print(zombies.key.key)  # "staff/zombies.jpg"

clowns = S3Uri.to_uri("circus", "clowns.jpg")
print(clowns.uri)  # "s3://circus/clowns.jpg"

burger_prefix = S3Uri.to_uri("expo") / "photos" / "burger-"
polenta = burger_prefix + "polenta.jpg"

print(polenta.uri)  # "s3://expo/photos/burger-polenta.jpg"
print(polenta.parent)  # "s3://expo/photos/"
```

## Installation

Slash3 requires Python 3.9 or later and can be installed from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/slash3/).

```shell
pip install slash3
```
